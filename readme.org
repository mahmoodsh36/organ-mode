* emphasized ideas and goals

- *extensibility*: the features should be extensible and customizable.
- *community*: ideally, the features should be liked and inspired by the community's needs. if all goes well, we could eventually make a draft to lem's codebase and get builtin org-mode-like features.
- *performance*: the code should be performant. the "org-agenda buffer" should load instantly even when it has to parse thousands of files. this is possible by a parser written from scratch in common lisp, which will also be improved even further in the future.

* notes

- most of the functionality for parsing is currently present in ~cltpt~ (the base code for parsing org and other formats).
- code and features in this repo will be lem-specific, but cltpt will remain editor-independent with a commandline interface.
- progress is bound to be slow but steady (like it has been for some time now)
- the goal is not to have a completely faithful, but an /almost faithful/ replication of org-mode features where it matters. the vision of an "improved" version of org-mode is more important than maintaining total compatbility.
